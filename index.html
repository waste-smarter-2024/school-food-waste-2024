              <p class="lh-base text-center">There is no doubt that food waste is a detrimental problem worldwide. While researching food waste, my partner and I realized that one of the core roots of food waste was cafeteria waste in schools. As highschoolers, we realized this quality of life issue was something we should take action upon. Our mission is to bring awareness to students in NYC district schools about food waste and how students could help reduce cafeteria waste. We want students to have the knowledge to recycle and throw out food into labeled bins as well as having an understanding of how food waste is impacting us not only in school settings, but environmentally as well.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center pad-around text-decoration-underline">Background</h2>
            <p class="lh-base text-center">Public schools in NYC have contributed to the worldwide problem of food waste. Though many may not know, food waste in cafeterias impacts not only the schools but the students as well. Budget wise, ninety-six billion pounds of food is wasted which is worth $165 billion. From this, $1.2 billion of the total food waste is solely from food in America. Schools and the federal government are wasting billions of dollars on food waste that can be easily reduced if awareness was spread. Continuously, trash bins which go into landfills emit air pollution and release toxic chemicals into our environment such as carbon dioxide and methane. Food waste impacts the environment more than what we think.</p>
